# Traffic Lights Optimization with Reinforcement Learning techniques

## Overview
This project simulates a traffic intersection with traffic lights and cars using Pygame. The goal of the simulation is to maximize the throughput of cars at the intersections with stoplights by optimizing the traffic light policies using Reinforcement Learning techniques. The simulation can work with a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model for optimizing the traffic light policies or with fixed times for the stoplights as a baseline of comparison. Cars are spawned according to a customizable policy, and various statistics are tracked during the simulation.

## Features
- Simulates traffic lights at an intersection.
- Supports two traffic light policies: MDP and Fixed Time for baseline comparison.
- Uses Reinforcement Learning techniques to maximize the throughput of cars.
- Customizable car spawn policies.
- Displays real-time statistics and information about the simulation.
- Visual representation of cars and traffic lights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
